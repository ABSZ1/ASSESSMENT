# Assignment Contribution
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alex:
Throughout the project we decided to split the assignment into tasks and make it fair for each member and updated the each version on to git hub as well as that, we would have calls outside of class in which we would work together to finish the task. Based on our understanding on the topic and seeking help, I feel comfortable knowing that we all have a full understanding of what we have done.
